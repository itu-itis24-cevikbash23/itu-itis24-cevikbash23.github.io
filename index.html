            I'm Hamza, I'm one of the students of ITU Computer Engineering.<br>
            I've been living in Isparta for all my life up until now and I'm really excited about this new chapter in my life.
            I was not that social in life mostly having few but very close friends. I was fascinated by the computers since I was
            a kid. I really want to learn more about them and create usefull products for the world by using it.

        <h2><i>Academic Interests</i></h2>
        <p>
            In highschool my favorite classes were biology, math and chemistry. While I'm not sure
            about what path I want to take in computer engineering, I really enjoy math and linear 
            algebra which I'm taking for the first time this year.
